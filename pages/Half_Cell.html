<h1>Half-Cell Method</h1>
<p>
In order to determine the diffusion coefficient of the contaminants migrating through the barrier material, half-cell method can be employed. Laboratory test simulating one-dimensional diffusive transport is performed through this method. The description of the method can be found in Shackelford (1991). In this method two half cells filled with soil are taken and tagged together. In one of the half-cell the soil is contaminated and in the other half-cell the soil is uncontaminated. As such when both the half cells are connected together there will be migration of contaminants from one half-cell to the other. The contaminated half-cell from which the migration occurs can be termed as source and the other half cell can be termed as receiver. With time the concentration in the source cell decreases as the contaminants diffuses into the receiver cell. After the diffusion test is over the soil mass in each half cell is sliced and analyzed for the variation of the concentration with depth. The analytical solution of diffusion equation given by Shackelford 1991, which is derived from Fickâ€™s second law of diffusion equation for soil and is given as:

where D* is the effective diffusion coefficient, c is the concentration at any time t and x is the distance. The D* value is assumed and then theoretical profile is fitted to the experimental data. The solution to equation 1 is based upon some initial and boundary conditions where two cases are considered, one is infinite case and the other is finite case.

In the infinite porous medium case the concentration profile does not reach the ends of the half-cell as depicted in figure 1a, where the origin is taken at the interface of the half cells. The initial and boundary conditions are given as follows:

	Corresponding to the above initial and boundary conditions, the solution to equation 1 is given by Crank (1975) as:

	In the finite porous medium case the concentration profile reaches to the ends of the half-cell as depicted in figure 1b. The initial and boundary condition for such a case is given as:
