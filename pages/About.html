<p>
	CONTRADIS stands for "<b>CON</b>taminant <b>TRA</b>nsport due to <b>DI</b>ffusion in <b>S</b>oils"

This software package is built for the purpose of checking the validity of various methods that have been used by the previous studies in the field of contaminant transport in soils. 
<br/>
<br/>
There are different methods that use different parameters to study the flow of different ions/ contaminants through a given sample of soil. This package demonstrates two of those methods, namely, <b>Through Diffusion technique</b> and <b>Half-Cell Method</b>.
<br/>
<br/>
This software is also capable of using the contaminant transport data from experiments and predicting the diffusion parameters used in Fick&#39s second law. Currently, it considers the data from the calculated concentration values as the experimental data.
